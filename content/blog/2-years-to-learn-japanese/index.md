## The beginning

I worked my ass off, I did everything I thought was right. I tried as hard as I could, and I didn't end up where I wanted to be. This is the story of my 2 year struggle with Japanese.

I just want to preface that this post is not about discouraging anyone from studying Japanese and/or a second language. I just want to dispel some myths and help people set realistic expectations for themselves.

At the time of writing this post it has been almost 3 years since I started studying Japanese and I still don't consider myself fluent. Let's start out with the definition of fluency from google -

> (of a person) able to express oneself easily and articulately.

I think the definition the fluency for everyone is different, but for myself fluency meant the above definition but also meant a lot more. It meant being able to do the the things a normal Japanese person could do. This means, watching TV, listening to radio, communicating with cashiers, understanding locals, being able to go on dates and just overall, ease of **understanding** and speaking Japanese.

When I first moved to Japan I was a Snowboarding Instructor and lived up in Hokkaido in a ski town called Niseko and initially had zero desire to learn Japanese being totally surrounded by foreigners. After about a month or two of living there I started realizing how awesome Japanese sounded to me and how useful it would be to be able to speak and read Japanese. I thought how fucking awesome would it be if I could learn what a "Spirit Bomb" was in Japanese. And every time I looked at some mysterious Japanese text it motivated me to start learning.

So after reading some reddit posts, looking at all the cool language apps in the play store and watching some youtube videos I said "fuck it, lets do it, how hard could this whole Japanese thing be?"

tldr: 意外に難しかった、 fucking hard.

I felt inspired after watching some polyglot videos about some slightly overweight irish fellow learning japanese in just 3 months! And reading about this so called 69-31 errr, 80-20 rule. A lot of these so called polyglot gurus and internet senseis said you could do it in about 6 months - 1 year IF you worked HARD. So I said "God damn it, I'm a pretty resourceful guy and I live in Japan, if anyone can do it in 6 months to a year I can right?"

## Stage 1 - Got Apps bro? and Pimsleur (0-3 months)

So about sometime in the middle of December I started visiting the [reddit.com/r/learnjapanese](http://reddit.com/r/learnjapanese) subreddit like it was my religion. I saw the instagram ads, the blog posts, the youtube videos, the paid advertisements.

I decided in this digital age the best way to learn a language was with Apps, so I downloaded them all, Duolingo, Lingodeer, Memorize, Anki, some japanese dictionaries, and I started learning how to read. I also had a friend who was able to _seemingly_ have decent conversation with locals from only using Pimsleur for a few months before coming to Japan.

So I started only maybe spending about ~30 mins a day studying but that quickly escalated to several hours a day. I was learning Hiragana, Katakana, then quickly moved to the Kanji. I became obsessed pretty quickly, but unfortunately I hurt my shoulder on a failed back-flip attempt (who knew that you could pop out out your shoulder and concuss yourself at the same time?) and it sort of forced me into a retirement from teaching snowboarding, which was great because now I could find a job where I study japanese and japanese culture full time!

So after about 2~3 months of using the apps and Pimsleur I was better than all my other Gaijin friends, I had finished the Duolingo tree, I was done almost all of the Lingodeer lessons, I knew a few hundred kanji but I still nowhere close to to fluent. I couldn't understand what the store clerks were saying, I could only read the most basic of signs, I certainly could not hold a conversation unless it was about the most basic of things (weather, hello, hot cold things like that). The thing that bothered me the most was that no matter how much grammar, vocab, kanji and everything that I learnt I could not understand ANYTHING that any one said back to me. That pudgy Irish polyglot had deceived me...

## Stage 2 - Genki and Anki, to infinity and beyond (3months - 1 year)

I decided that being in Japan wasn't just enough but to get myself in a truly immersive environment I would need to move to the 田舎 aka the japanese countryside. So I found myself teaching English at mountain school in the middle of nowhere Japan and for the first little while it was truly living the dream.

![My old school traditional style house, does it get any more Japanese that tatami mats!?](./tatamihouse.jpg)

At this point in my Japanese journey I felt pretty good about my Japanese level, I was better than all my friends in Hokkaido and could start to read more and more. I was very much so, in relation to the dunning-kruger effect at the top of Mt. Stupid and god damn, I felt good.

![My stupid self right at that first peak.](./dunningkruger.png)

I started my long tumble from the top of Mt Stupid very shortly after moving and living with other Gaijin who were much more fluent in Japanese than myself. My first realizations that not only was I no where near fluent but Japanese was in fact horrible was about the first or second day, when my Japanese co-worker took me around to 挨拶 (aisatsu) or greet all our Japanese neighbors. It was my first time hearing that word and the first I did was announce to all my coworkers that I was going 暗殺 (ansatsu) all my neighbors. Just a small pronunciation mistake but I had just announced to all of 15 coworkers that I was going to assassinate all of my neighbors ... Not the best first impression. Also while in the midst of brutally assassinating ... I mean pleasantly greeting all neighbors, I had the awful realization couldn't understand anything of what was being spoken, **nothing**. It felt like being floundering child lost in the middle of the ocean. I had arrived to the bottom of the Valley of Despair.

How could this be I had used all the apps reddit had recommended, I spent the time, I was learning the kanji maybe I knew about ~500 by then. What was wrong? Surely after 3 months I should be able to understand something right!?

So I went back to the drawing board and tried to revise my study strategy to become within this 1 year mark. This time I called upon the reddit sensei's and cast out the internet blogging gurus (Sorry Benny but fuck you), and started consuming their beginner wiki like every word was the word of GOD him self. The result of my research from the holy father is as follows.

1. Thou shall buy the holy text Genki and study grammar everyday.
2. Thou shall ONLY use Anki and forego the other sacrilegious apps (sorry duolingo and others).
3. Thou shall learn to **read**.

Some other concepts reddit told me was that it was important to listen, read, speak and do grammar study everyday. So I really tried to focus on those things and tried to do as much as I could everyday. My main study tools were Anki Core 6k deck, 常用漢字 (common usage kanji) deck, Italki lessons and the Bibl... I mean Genki. A typical day would look like as follows -

- 7am-8am, wake-up and do anki ~ 1 hour, plus 15 new words a day, and 10 new kanji a day.
- 9am- 3pm, go to work and try to listen to as much Japanese as possible from student other teachers etc.
- 4pm - bedtime, study Genki, try to read manga, children's books, or watch some anime usually with english subtitles.

I would also try to do about 2 Italki lessons a week. I felt with all of this I was listening, reading, talking, and studying grammar just about everyday. And according to the gurus and the reddit senpais I could become fluent in less then a year.

I would say the total active study time was about 2 hours plus doing my best to listen while at school and consume Japanese media in japanese as best as I could. I did my best to study but I also did a lot of traveling and exploring and having a lot of fun.

This continued on for about 9 months and I was definitely making progress I was getting better I could start to have conversations (1 hour conversations with my Italki teachers), I could begin to understand some manga's, I was able to start to function in Japanese society. But there was still so much I couldn't do. I couldn't buy a car or get my license without a translator, I couldn't understand anything in Keigo (polite Japanese speech), I couldn't understand 95 percent of what the kids were saying, I couldn't even answer the most basic questions asked by the villagers, I would just smile and nod and walk away awkwardly.In hindsight I should of もう一回ください-ed (one more time please) to death.

But despite this all of my coworkers were really astounded by how hard I was studying and how fast I was progressing. My reading ability was quickly exceeding my listening and speaking ability. Everyone was impressed, except for myself.

I felt a 3 year old, I couldn't express the ideas I wanted to express, I couldn't understand basic conversations between native speakers. I would say my speaking and understanding level was that of a toddler, probably even worst because toddlers pitch accents and pronunciation are really fucking awesome.

## Stage 3 - JLPT N2 - the final frontier??? (1 - 1.5 years)

I wasn't fluent, I didn't feel fluent at all. I still struggled at so many things, but I was making good progress with the reddit senseis study plan and I was sticking to my study schedule, but it was time to get serious. It has been a year and enough is enough time to get fluent, the last thing that some of the online community claimed was a basic fluency or even a business proficiency - The Japanese Language Proficiency Test N2. I had been studying just about a year and most people claimed that getting to N2 level in a year to a year and a half was *possible* but very difficult. This was the last way I knew of to become fluent in Japanese.

After doing my extensive reddit research was I concluded that I needed to know and do, to pass the N2 was the following-

1. Learn around 6000 words.
2. Learn around 1000 N2 Kanji.
3. Finish at LEAST the grammar textbook Tobira.
4. Listen to as much Japanese as possible.
5. Read as much Japanese as possible.
6. Finish several N2 mock tests.

At this point I knew about 3500 words (from my core 6k deck), and already knew about ~1000 Kanji (from the kanji deck), and was about half way through genki two. When I had crunched the numbers what I needed to do was learn ~500 words a month, 2 grammar chapters a week, as much listening and reading as I could do every day.

So I signed up. I had about 5 months to cram as much Japanese knowledge into my brain. I had my plan, I was ready. Many of coworkers who had previously failed the JLPT N2 told me it was an impossible task to pass the N2 in such a short period of time and that added more fuel to the fire. I did what a called "rage studying" a level a zen that can only be achieved when trying to *"prove all the haters wrong"*.

These next 5 months studied probably the hardest I ever did in my life. Every single Japanese word that was spoken at work I listened like they whispering the answer to the JLPT test questions themselves. I was using Anki so much I started to dream in flash cards. I studied so much grammar that it would make my Elementary school french teacher proud. Basically **every waking moment was studying Japanese**.

A couple of interesting resources I found while studying were Nihongo Con Teppei - A Japanese Podcast for Intermediates, the second was Matt vs Japan's Youtube channel. Before you say "this asshole I knew it, filthy AJATTer" hear me out.

When I first started listening to [Nihongo Con Teppei](http://teppeisensei.com/) I could hardly follow much of what he was saying, but if I listened and listened again, every subsequent listen I could pick up more and more. This was the one resource that I truly felt improved my Japanese more than anything else in terms of speaking and understanding casual Japanese. I can not recommend this podcast enough to low intermediates all the way to lower advanced learners. **THIS PODCAST HELPED ME COMMUNICATE IN JAPANESE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE**. In terms of time spent listening to real life results with my Japanese, nothing else that I used to study compares. ありがとうございました　鉄平先生！

The second resource is Matt's channel, and up until this point I had laughed in the face of the Ajatt-ers because I was living the real AJATT (All Japanese All The Time). A few things he said really changed my whole perspective on studying Japanese. The first was that you could become fluent in Japanese without speaking a word which basically means your Japanese level is a function of your input NOT your output. The second was that the process to become actually be REALLY fluent. Not Benny fucking... I mean snake oil salesman fluent, was actually around 3-4 years, at the bare minimum.

And Teppei Sensei was saying the same thing, his perspective was almost the exact same at Matt's. A very simple message "you want to be fluent in Japanese?" The answer "Just listen". That's it. So simple but it blew my fucking mind. These were people who were legit fluent in their target language, people who dedicated a big portion of their lives to language learning. Here I was practicing Kanji, reading manga, doing grammar exercises, listening to people explain japanese concepts in english. But I had neglected the most important thing - Listening to Japanese.

I didn't really change the way I studied after this because I had optimized my study schedule to destroy the JLPT N2 and 5 months later I did. I scored 112/160 a solid pass. I had done the impossible (well at the least the improbable). I did what the reddit senseis, the internet gurus, the online community told me what it took to become fluent. Can you guess if I was fluent? Short answer - HELL NO.

Long answer - I could read basic articles, I could hold basic conversations, I could finally start to understand the world around me, I could do almost everything on my own without a translator. I could live in this Japanese world and function. But I still sucked, I still had to concentrate with the force of Picollo firing a special beam cannon every time I listened to someone speak, I couldn't understand native Japanese people speaking to each other, it took me 10x longer to read something than a japanese person. This was fluent? Surely no one would consider this fluent? If I were to compare myself to a child I was about a 4 year old in terms of listening and about a 8 year old in terms of reading. Maybe not even that.

## Stage 4 - Okinawa - the finalest frontier!?!? (1.5 - 2 years)

After all this JLPT stuff. I was tired of my job and not sure about my life in Japan, whether I wanted to make this my home or not, and decided it was time to go home and regroup, but not before one final hurray - Okinawa.

Up until this point I feel like I worked just about as hard as one can in a year and a halfs time. Even though my study tactics had not been perfect I had still put in the time and I think I had it figured out now. I needed to be in an environment with **no english**. So I decided the best place for my study-cation was the island of Ishigaki. 

This time 100% I was going to be fluent or at least damn close. The new study plan was to listen to as much japanese as possible, sentence mining (creating anki cards from anime or tv shows), and reading at least an hour every day.

## Stage 5 - 本当に最後があるのかよ!? This is taking forever.

I felt at the end of my time in Ishigaki that finally I was getting there, finally I could see measurable progress. I felt that maybe an additional 1 year there would of gotten me to some decent level of fluency.

I like to think of learning Japanese as an RPG. Every step of the way, every level up you get new skills, new powers, new equipment, and god damn it is so awesome. But just like RPG's it takes longer to level up the higher you, you might even wondering if you are even gaining any experience points. 

In the end I was able to a lot of what I set out to do. I went on dates, I talked with the locals, I learned how to watch anime, I learned how to read the manga,  I learned the Japanese word for Spirit Bomb (元気玉くらえ!!!) but most importantly I learned you can't fucking be fluent in Japanese in under 2 years. But don't let that stop you from trying!
