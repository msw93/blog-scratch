I worked my ass off, I did everything I thought was right. I tried as hard as I could, and I didn't end up where I wanted to be. This is the story of my 2 year struggle wish Japanese.

I just want to preface that this post is not about discouraging anyone from studying Japanese and/or a second language. I just want to dispel some myths and help people set realistic expectations for themselves.

At the time of writing this post it has been almost 3 years since I started studying Japanese and I still don't consider myself fluent. I'd like to start out with the definition of fluency from google -

> (of a person) able to express oneself easily and articulately.
