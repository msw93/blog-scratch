Hello language learning community, what if I told you there is a secret weapon that most people don't take advantage of when learning a second language, a total game-changer!?
Language learning communities don't want you to know this one dirty little secret!

If you want to know the secret please watch the following 69 ads and click through 1000 paywall! ...oh shit I forgot I put the answer in the title...

Oh well, the answer is **podcasts** thats right, so simple. Maybe you are thinking "I'm already are listening to podcasts, I don't need to keep reading", maybe you don't really like podcasts, maybe you think I am stupid and have no idea what I am talking about? Well all of those are probably correct. But keep reading I think the following post has something interesting and useful for everyone.

I first want to talk about why I think podcasts are one of the best, if not THE BEST resource out there for listening and should be part of everyone's study routine. And after I will give a few recommendations of podcasts of that I really enjoyed and have been very helpful to me.

**Disclaimer:** If you just want to say うんこ(unko aka poop) in Japanese and just want to learn the basics, like asking where the toilet is when you and friends are visiting the maid cafe on your dream vacation to Tokyo, then this post might not be for you. But for the people who want to become very fluent and potentially live and are living in Japan, then this post is for you!

1. **Fluency is measured is not minutes, but hours and thousands of hours at that.**

   Depending on who you ask. To achieve a high level of fluency in Japanese you need around 10000 study/exposure hours (source. me making shit up as per usual and personal experience). I think that most language learner who are in the upper intermediate to advanced level will agree, that progress slows down considerably and you start to realize how long the road is left. When you get to that stage you start to understand, "I need to get these 1000's of listening hours, but where the hell are they going to come from?".

   If you want to read more about how long I think it takes to become really good in Japanese, read my [previous article here](/2-years-to-learn-japanese/).

   Welcome to the world of podcasts young grasshoper.

   There are literally an almost infinite amount of hours of natural and interesting Japanese conversations out there that are a click away..

2. Podcasts give very natural unscripted speech.
   - I think nothing compares when it comes to natural speech. Most of the time podcasts are unscripted but follow a theme or a logical flow which makes them easy to follow.
